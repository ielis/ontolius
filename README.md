# Ontolius

Empower analysis with terms and hierarchy of biomedical ontologies.

## Examples

We provide examples of *loading* ontology and its subsequent *usage*
in applications.

### ðŸª„ðŸª„ðŸª„ Load HPO

`ontolius` can load HPO from Obographs JSON file.
For the sake of this example, we use
[flate2](https://github.com/rust-lang/flate2-rs)
to decompress gzipped JSON on the fly:

We can load the JSON file as follows:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

use flate2::bufread::GzDecoder;
use ontolius::io::OntologyLoaderBuilder;
use ontolius::ontology::csr::MinimalCsrOntology;

// Load a toy Obographs file from the repo
let path = "resources/hp.small.json.gz";

// Configure the loader to parse the input as an Obographs file
let loader = OntologyLoaderBuilder::new()
                .obographs_parser()
                .build();

let reader = GzDecoder::new(BufReader::new(File::open(path).unwrap()));
let hpo: MinimalCsrOntology = loader.load_from_read(reader)
                                .expect("HPO should be loaded");
```

> Note: Ontolius does *not* depend on `flate2`. It's up to you to provide
> the `loader` with proper data ðŸ˜±

We loaded an ontology from a toy JSON file. 
During the load, each term is assigned a numeric index and the indices are used as vertices 
of the ontology graph. 

As the name suggests, the hierarchy graph of `MinimalCsrOntology` 
is backed by an adjacency matrix in compressed sparse row (CSR) format.
However, the backing data structure should be treated as an implementation detail.
Note that `MinimalCsrOntology` implements the [`crate::ontology::Ontology`] trait
which is the API the client code should use. 

Now let's move on to the example usage.

### ðŸ¤¸ðŸ¤¸ðŸ¤¸ Use HPO

In the previous section, we loaded an ontology from Obographs JSON file.
Now we have an instance of [`crate::ontology::Ontology`] that can 
be used for various tasks.

Note, we will import the *prelude* [`crate::prelude`] to reduce the import boilerplate.

#### Work with ontology terms

[`crate::ontology::Ontology`] acts as a container of terms to support 
retrieval of specific terms by its index or `TermId`, and to iterate 
over all terms and `TermId`s. 

We can get a term by its `TermId`: 

```rust
# use std::fs::File;
# use std::io::BufReader;
# use flate2::bufread::GzDecoder;
# use ontolius::io::OntologyLoaderBuilder;
# use ontolius::ontology::csr::MinimalCsrOntology;
# let loader = OntologyLoaderBuilder::new().obographs_parser().build();
# let reader = GzDecoder::new(BufReader::new(File::open("resources/hp.small.json.gz").unwrap()));
# let hpo: MinimalCsrOntology = loader.load_from_read(reader)
#                                    .expect("HPO should be loaded");
#
use ontolius::TermId;
use ontolius::term::MinimalTerm;
use ontolius::ontology::OntologyTerms;

// `HP:0001250` corresponds to `Arachnodactyly``
let term_id: TermId = ("HP", "0001166").into();

// Get the term by its term ID and check the name. 
let term = hpo.term_by_id(&term_id).expect("Arachnodactyly should be present");

assert_eq!(term.name(), "Arachnodactyly");
```

or iterate over the all ontology terms or their corresponding term IDs:

```rust
# use std::fs::File;
# use std::io::BufReader;
# use flate2::bufread::GzDecoder;
# use ontolius::io::OntologyLoaderBuilder;
# use ontolius::ontology::csr::MinimalCsrOntology;
# let loader = OntologyLoaderBuilder::new().obographs_parser().build();
# let reader = GzDecoder::new(BufReader::new(File::open("resources/hp.small.json.gz").unwrap()));
# let hpo: MinimalCsrOntology = loader.load_from_read(reader)
#                                    .expect("HPO should be loaded");
#
use ontolius::ontology::OntologyTerms;

// The toy HPO contains 614 terms and primary term ids,
let terms: Vec<_> = hpo.iter_terms().collect();
assert_eq!(terms.len(), 614);
assert_eq!(hpo.iter_term_ids().count(), 614);

// and the total of 1121 term ids (primary + obsolete)
assert_eq!(hpo.iter_all_term_ids().count(), 1121);
```

See [`crate::ontology::OntologyTerms`] trait for more details.

### Browse the hierarchy

`ontolius` enables to leverage the ontology hierarchy
via several traits. This typically includes iteration over term's parents, ancestors, children, or descendants.

The [`crate::ontology::HierarchyWalks`] trait supports iterating through [`TermId`]s whereas [`crate::ontology::HierarchyTraversals`] enables iteration over ontology graph indices. Iterating over indices is slightly faster and can be useful if we do not really care about the actual term IDs (e.g. to test if term `a` is an ancestor of term `b`).

The [`crate::ontology::HierarchyQueries`] simplifies testing if term `a` is a parent, child, ancestor, or descendant of term `b`.

In all cases, the hierarchy is represented as a directed acyclic graph that is built from `is_a` relationships.

Let's see how to use the ontology hierarchy. For instance, we can use [`crate::ontology::HierarchyWalks::iter_parent_ids`] to get parent ids of a term:

```rust
# use std::fs::File;
# use std::io::BufReader;
# use flate2::bufread::GzDecoder;
# use ontolius::io::OntologyLoaderBuilder;
# use ontolius::ontology::csr::MinimalCsrOntology;
# use ontolius::TermId;
# use ontolius::term::MinimalTerm;
# let loader = OntologyLoaderBuilder::new().obographs_parser().build();
# let reader = GzDecoder::new(BufReader::new(File::open("resources/hp.small.json.gz").unwrap()));
# let hpo: MinimalCsrOntology = loader.load_from_read(reader)
#                                    .expect("HPO should be loaded");
#

use ontolius::ontology::{HierarchyWalks, OntologyTerms};


let arachnodactyly: TermId = "HP:0001166".parse()
                                .expect("CURIE should be valid");

let parent_names: Vec<_> = hpo.iter_parent_ids(&arachnodactyly)
                               .map(|idx| hpo.term_by_id(idx).expect("A term for a term ID obtained from ontology should always be present"))
                               .map(MinimalTerm::name)
                               .collect();
assert_eq!(vec!["Slender finger", "Long fingers"], parent_names);
```

We first create the `TermId` that corresponds to *Arachnodactyly* and then we query `hpo` for its parents by calling `iter_parent_ids`. We retrieve the term that corresponds to term id, extract its name, and collect the names into a vector.

Similar methods exist for getting term IDs of ancestors, children, and descendants of a term. See [`crate::ontology::HierarchyWalks`] for more info.


## Features

Ontolius includes several features, with the features marked by `(*)` being enabled
by default:

* `obographs` `(*)` - support loading Ontology from Obographs JSON file
* `pyo3` - add PyO3 bindings to selected data structs to support using from Python


## Run tests

The tests can be run by invoking:

```shell
cargo test
```

## Run benches

We use `criterion` for crate benchmarks.

Run the following to run the bench suite:

```shell
cargo bench
```

The benchmark report will be written into the `target/criterion/report` directory.
